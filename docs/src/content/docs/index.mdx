  tagline: A Style Dictionary uses design tokens to define styles once and use those styles on any platform or language. It provides a single place to create and edit your styles, and exports these tokens to all the places you need - iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, etc. It is available as a CLI through npm, but can also be used like any normal node module if you want to extend its functionality.

import tokens from '/public/demo-tokens.json';

## Live Demo

Below is a showcase of how a set of DTCG tokens would be exported to CSS:

<sd-playground tokens={JSON.stringify({ value: JSON.stringify(tokens, null, 2), lang: 'json'})} default-selected="tokens" id="main-demo">

  <div style="height: 100%" slot="monaco-editor"></div>
</sd-playground>

Upload your JSON or ZIP of tokens and convert them to DTCG format:
<sd-dtcg-convert></sd-dtcg-convert>
